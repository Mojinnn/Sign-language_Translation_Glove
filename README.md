## Processing
- Working with the Flex sensor and MPU6050
- Collect data
- Match to pattern
- Display on LCD and audio
Note: To connect, we must communicate (SPI, I2C, ADC, etc.)

## Expected result:
- We will demo 4 words: Hello, Yes, No, I love you
- We will use Arduino for the prototype because it supports a lot of libraries
- After completion, we will use PIC16F887 or STM32 to operate it (If I can)
